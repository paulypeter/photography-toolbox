If you want to implement or fix it yourself:

2. Ask to be the assignee for your created issue.
3. Fork the repository to your account.
4. Create a new branch for your implementation.
5. Implement the fix or feature. *
6. Commit and push your changes to your repository.
7. Create a [Pull Request](https://github.com/paulypeter/photography-toolbox/compare).

\* If you implement a new feature, add tests for it.
