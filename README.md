# photography-toolbox

A toolbox for calculationg Depth of Field, Exposure and much more to come

## Goal

The goal for this project is to provide a wrapper for all calculations a photographer would like to make.

These include:
- effects of sensor size
  - depth of field
  - equivalent focal length
  - field of view
- equivalent exposures
  - for night photography?
  - for flash photography
- maybe? sunrise and sunset times
- macro settings

and so on
